                                        DISTANCE FROM MEAN
  1. We’ve given you a very small dataset of five values named grades. These are five randomly chosen grades from the first teacher’s class. We’ve also calculated the mean of this small 
dataset and stored it in a variable named mean. Let’s find the difference between each of these data points and the mean. We’ve created a variable for each difference. Start with 
difference_one. Change the value of difference_one — it should be equal to the first value in the data set minus mean.
  2. Fill in the correct values for difference_two through difference_five. Some of these values will be negative! Make sure to follow the formula exactly. difference = X − μ
//
import numpy as np
grades = [88, 82, 85, 84, 90]
mean = np.mean(grades)
difference_one = grades[0] - mean
difference_two = grades[1] - mean
difference_three = grades[2] - mean
difference_four = grades[3] - mean
difference_five = grades[4] - mean
print("The mean of the data set is " + str(mean) + "\n")
print("The first student is " +str(round(difference_one, 2)) + " percentage points away from the mean.")
print("The second student is " +str(round(difference_two, 2)) + " percentage points away from the mean.")
print("The third student is " +str(round(difference_three, 2)) + " percentage points away from the mean.")
print("The fourth student is " +str(round(difference_four, 2)) + " percentage points away from the mean.")
print("The fifth student is " +str(round(difference_five, 2)) + " percentage points away from the mean.")

                                        AVERAGE DISTANCES
  3. Sum the five variables difference_one through difference_five and store the result in the variable difference_sum.
//
difference_sum = difference_one + difference_two + difference_three + difference_four + difference_five
  4. Divide difference_sum by 5 and store the result in the variable named average_difference. Think about the answer. Do you think it accurately captures the spread of your data?
//
print("The sum of the differences is " + str(format(difference_sum, ".28f")))                RESULT: The sum of the differences is 0.0000000000000142108547152020
print("The average difference is " + str(format(average_difference, ".28f")))                RESULT: The average difference is     0.0000000000000028421709430404

                                        SQUARE THE DIFFERENCES
  5. Square each of the values stored in the variables difference_one through difference_five. In Python, to square a number, use the ** operator. The code below gives you an example of 
squaring the variable a. squared_num = a ** 2
//
difference_one = (88 - mean)**2
difference_two = (82 - mean)**2
difference_three = (85 - mean)**2
difference_four = (84 - mean)**2
difference_five = (90 - mean)**2
difference_sum = difference_one + difference_two + difference_three + difference_four + difference_five
variance = difference_sum / 5
print("The sum of the squared differences is " + str(difference_sum))                        RESULT: The sum of the squared differences is 40.8
print("The variance is " + str(variance))                                                    RESULT: The variance is 8.16

  6. Scroll down in the code to find where we’ve definied teacher_one_variance and teacher_two_variance. Set those variables equal to the variance of each dataset using the np.var() function.
